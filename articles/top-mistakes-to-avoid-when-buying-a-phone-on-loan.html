    <!-- Intro -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Buying a phone on loan in Uganda has become very popular, thanks to providers like <strong>MOGO</strong>, <strong>Watu</strong>, and <strong>TakeNow</strong>. With a small deposit, anyone can walk away with a brand-new Tecno, Infinix, or Itel. But while this sounds exciting, many people rush in without thinking through the long-term implications. Letâ€™s explore the most common mistakes to avoid.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mistakes -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>1. Getting Too Excited and Forgetting the Real Reason</h3>
      <p>Many people are thrilled by the idea of finally owning a smartphone, but in their excitement, they forget <em>why</em> they actually needed it. Was it for business, communication, or schoolwork? If you lose sight of the real purpose, you may end up with a model that doesnâ€™t serve your needs.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>2. Focusing Only on the Small Deposit</h3>
      <p>The deposit is usually small â€” sometimes just <strong>20â€“30%</strong> â€” and this makes the loan feel affordable. But many forget to consider the <strong>total repayment amount</strong> and the length of time theyâ€™ll be paying. What feels cheap at first may become expensive in the long run.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>3. Ignoring Durability of the Phone</h3>
      <p>Ask yourself: will the phone still be in good condition by the time you finish paying for it? Some people finish 12 months of payments only to find the phone outdated, damaged, or underperforming. Always balance features with durability before signing.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>4. Comparing Loan Prices with Cash Prices</h3>
      <p>Many buyers make the mistake of comparing phone loan prices with cash prices. But remember: <strong>a loan is a loan</strong>. It comes with interest. If you keep comparing, you may talk yourself out of it or feel cheated. Instead, focus on whether the loan terms fit your lifestyle and budget.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>5. Missing Payments</h3>
      <p>When you miss payments, you face penalties or even repossession. Some companies may also share your information with credit bureaus, which affects your ability to get bigger loans in the future. Choose a plan you can realistically maintain â€” daily, weekly, or monthly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>6. Signing Without Reading</h3>
      <p>Excitement can make you sign contracts without reading the fine print. Always confirm details about <strong>hidden fees, repossession rules, warranty coverage, and early repayment options</strong>. This protects you from surprises later.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Taking a phone on loan in Uganda is a smart move if you do it with clear understanding. Donâ€™t let excitement blind you. Think about the total cost, durability, and repayment schedule. Remember: itâ€™s not about comparing with cash, but about choosing a loan that works for you.</p>
